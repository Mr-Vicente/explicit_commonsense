    <h1>Commonsense Textual Generation Evaluation</h1>

    <h3>Introduction (Welcome to this HIT!)</h3>
    <p><strong>What is Commonsense? </strong>Commonsense is strongly bounded to what makes sense in the world, regarding humans' knowledge, conventions and our lovely ability to reason and deduce about events <br>
      <strong>Example:</strong> if it's raining we might grab an umbrella to go outdoors (not to get wet): this is Commonsense Reasoning. 
        <br><strong>Motivation: </strong>Machine emulations of language, however, have difficulties dealing with such natural human behaviour, therefore we produced some research to tackle this problem.</p>
    <p> <strong>Your task:</strong> Follow the instructions and provide your input to each step task.</p>
    <p><strong>Note:</strong> If you have some doubts, please check <strong>Further information</strong></p> 
    
        <full-instructions text="help">
        <p>Read the task carefully and complete the task.</p>
        <p>Choose the appropriate ratings and provide meaningful answers.</p>
      </full-instructions>
      <short-instructions>
        <p></p>Provide ratings to generated sentences for the first 2 HIT steps;</p>
        <p></p>For the 3 HIT step: Write a sentence using the concepts given (and others if you want), 
        as long as the concepts given are used and the sentence makes sense;</p>
        <p></p>Provide rating to question-answer pairs for the last HIT step;</p>
      </short-instructions>

            <p>We are evaluating the quality of textual generation, so we have prepared this HIT to access the Human Level Performance of Lnaguage Models.</p>

        <detailed-instructions>
            <p><strong>Step 1)</strong> Read the sentences below and use the sliders below to indicate how rich in commonsense they are (1 = lacking commonsense, 5 = human-like sentence).</p>
            <p><strong>Step 2)</strong> Read the sentences below and use the sliders below to indicate how descriptive they are (1 = not descriptive, 5 = interestingly descriptive).</p>
            <p><strong>Step 3)</strong> Given some concepts, create a sentence which makes sense and uses all concepts (you can use other concepts as long as you use the ones mentioned).</p>
            <p><strong>Step 4)</strong> Read the questions and the respective answers below and use the sliders below to indicate how reasonable they are, even if you don't know the answer (1 = not reasonable, 5 = is right/makes sense)</p>

        <positive-example>
            <h3><strong>Step 1)</strong> Model Sentence</h3>
            <p>Dog is chasing a cat.</p>

            <h3>Response (Ranking)</h3>
            <p>5</p>

        <positive-example>
            <h3><strong>Step 3)</strong> Concepts</h3>
            <p>water, boat, bird</p>

            <h3>Response</h3>
            <p>Boat moves over water, while birds are singing.</p>

        <negative-example>
            <h3><strong>Step 1)</strong> Model Sentence</h3>
            <p>Dog buys a toy to a cat.</p>

            <h3>Response (Ranking)</h3>
            <p>5</p>
            <span><strong>Why?</strong> Sintatically the sentence is correct, but makes no sense in the real world. Maybe the ranking should be a 1,2. </span>

            <h3><strong>Step 3)</strong> Concepts</h3>

            <h3>Response</h3>
            <p>boat flies over the sky to task to birds.</p>
            <span><strong>Why?</strong> Makes no sense and misses the concept [water]</span>
